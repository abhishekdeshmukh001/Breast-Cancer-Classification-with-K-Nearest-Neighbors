## Title: Breast Cancer Classification with K-Nearest Neighbors

### A. Description:
This project is aimed at developing a machine learning model to classify breast cancer tumors as either benign or malignant based on various features extracted from breast biopsy data. The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is employed for this binary classification task.

### B. Dataset Description: 
The dataset contains various attributes such as clump thickness, marginal adhesion, bare nuclei, bland chromatin, etc.

We will be using the following dataset:

## -Steps Implemented:

### 1. Data Preprocessing:
* Performed data cleaning to handle missing values, if any.
* Explored the dataset's structure, summary statistics, and distribution of features.
* Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

### 2. Data Visualization:
* Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations such as Histograms, Box plots and Heatmap to understand feature distributions and relationships.

### 3. Model Building:
* Implemented the KNN algorithm using scikit-learn.
* Experiment with different values of K (number of neighbors) to find the optimal configuration.
* Trained the KNN model on the training dataset.

### 4. Model Evaluation:
* Evaluated the KNN model's performance on the testing dataset using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
* Visualize performance metrics to gain insights into the model's strengths and weaknesses.
